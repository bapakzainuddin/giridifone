A maverick leader from an early age, Raúl served as his country’s minister of defense and assumed presidential duties alongside his brother Fidel for several years before eventually claiming full responsibility himself.</p><p>He stepped down from office in 2018 but remains involved in Cuban politics today - a reminder that he is still an active force in the region. His hard work throughout the decades and dedication to serving his people are admired far beyond Cuba's borders - not just by citizens of other countries with whom he shares common values and interests, but also within his own nation where he continues to be revered by many who recognize him as one of their greatest leaders ever.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/luxlux.net/lux/wp-content/uploads/raul-castro-3-scaled.jpeg alt="Raúl Castro photo 2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 id=what-is-raul-castros-zodiac-sign><span id=What_is_Raul_Castros_Zodiac_Sign>What is Raúl Castro’s Zodiac Sign</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro is a Gemini, born on June 3, 1931.

His familiarity with both sides makes him an amazing mediator - something which may come in handy for when difficult decisions need to be taken.</p><p>His endless curiosity means that he’s constantly searching for more information before committing himself to anything, so he can make the best decision possible no matter how intricate the situation may seem. At 92 years of age but still at the top of his political game after over 6 decades as leader of Cuba’s Communist party – it seems like this Gemini has already proved his beliefs right!</p><h2 id=raul-castro-net-worth-and-earnings><span id=Raul_Castro_Net_Worth_and_Earnings>Raúl Castro Net Worth and Earnings</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro's Net Worth is estimated to be around $100 Million. In Cuba, Raúl Castro is considered a revolutionary hero, and in recognition of his political career, the 91-year-old former President of the Councils of State and Ministers has built up quite a fortune over the years.</p><p>Even at his advanced age, he remains one of the wealthiest people in Cuba. Castro started his journey as a young rebel leader who joined Fidel's 26th of July Movement during an attack on Santiago de Cuba’s Moncada Barracks that sparked off the Cuban Revolution.</p><p>He was later appointed Commander-in-Chief of Cuban Armed Forces in 1959 and served as its first Minister of Defense until 2008 when Fidel handed him presidency before eventually resigning in 2018 due to health reasons. Though it may not compare to luxury lifestyles seen elsewhere in the world, Raul Castro's net worth allows him to enjoy a comfortable retirement with all expenses taken care off — something many Cubans can only dream about living their lives under US sanctions since 1962.</p><p>In this light, it can be said that Raul's wealth has proved beneficial for himself and for many others too.</p><h2 id=raul-castro-nationality-and-ethnicity><span id=Raul_Castro_Nationality_and_Ethnicity>Raúl Castro Nationality and Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Raúl Castro is a Cuban politician.
