Viviana upped the ante of her performance by immersing herself in the water of a bathtub on stage before leaping into the air with only one hand on the aerial rope. In the end, she was spinning above the tub by only her neck, leaving the judges dumbfounded and in wonder. Sofia described it as "sensational," noting that the water added dramatic flair. Howie appreciated it because it was scary, and she was athletic, Heidi was entranced, and Simon stated she was far superior to previous performances.</p><p>Sofia thought the performance was sensational, dangerous, beautiful, and unique. She went on to say that the water contributed to the dramatic performance and that she would love to see something like this in a James Bond film. Howie admired her athleticism and found the act to be both dangerous and captivating. He slipped in a joke about Viviana's performance being like a laundry session. During her performance, Heidi felt hypnotized. She also mentions that the fast spins had her hands "wet" as she sat there, frightened for her. However, everything was perfect and stunning. Simon recalls seeing a similar performance in one of the previous seasons, although he felt Viviana was far superior. All four judges agreed it was a "definite Yes," and Viviana advanced. Fans on social media went gaga over her performance, with one calling her as the next star born on the stage of 'AGT'.
