Sadly, by the time she mastered the song, her father was tired of hearing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But that did not mean that he'd stop supporting his daughter in her pursuit.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>For&nbsp;Tyler Reese Tritt, Music Is Family</h2><p>Tyler shared further along in the video that for her, music meant everything to her. It was family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Waylon Jennings held me when I was a baby," she flaunted before admitting that she always knew that country music was what she wanted to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to put into words how the music made her feel, she couldn't go much further than claiming that she became a different person when she was performing.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like I can just take over the world. It's an amazing feeling. It's something I can't get from anything else.</p><h2>Travis Tritt Let His Daughter Perform Alongside Him</h2><p>Being the doting dad that he is, Travis has always supported his child's&nbsp;dreams.&nbsp;With that being said, he did hold back on launching her as a child. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As per reports from <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Countryfancast</a>, Travis' wife Theresa Nelson Tritt confirmed that&nbsp;Disney and <a href=# rel=follow>Nickelodeon</a> wanted to sign Tyler early on, but Travis wouldn't agree to it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, he gave her the time to hone her skills as a performer and let her perform under his wing as often as he could.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Travis Tritt singing for&nbsp;Tyler Reese Tritt as a kid </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first time that the father-daughter duo performed for the public was on Father's Day&nbsp;2013.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two of them came together to sing a cover of&nbsp;Patty Smyth and Don Henley's hit, 'Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough.'</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Tyler Reese Tritt's Debut Single</h2><p>On November 3, 2017, Tyler got out from under her father's caring wings and set out on her own with the release of her debut single 'Perfect' with Post Oak Recordings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The song was produced by Jesse Owen Astin and co-written by Astin, Adam Folsom, and Dionne Osborne.</p><p>On a later date, she shared that the sole intent behind the song was to form a connection with her audiences.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"I want everyone to hear it and say, 'that reminds me of my first love,'" she affirmed,&nbsp;"That common thread of the excitement of a first love, the heartache, and feeling that never really leaves even with the passing of time."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyilsOqv4ytqaKspGKxosHGoaueql2stqexjaGrpqQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-tritt-daughter-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-stars-in-americas-got-talent-fantasy-league-meet-the-former-contestants-who-will-grace-the-agt-stage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-stars-in-americas-got-talent-fantasy-league-meet-the-former-contestants-who-will-grace-the-agt-stage.html>Who stars in 'America's Got Talent: Fantasy League'?
