Consequently, she was in a commercial when she turned eleven months and was a movie star by seven.</p><p class=Zg>Unfortunately, the early exposure to stardom and freedom as a child put her on a dangerous path. She was addicted to drugs by the time she turned twelve, cut her wrists at thirteen, and was emancipated at fourteen.</p><p class=Zg>Barrymore has been candid with her fans about her life journey, including being the ultimate party girl at eight years old.
