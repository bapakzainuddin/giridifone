<time>25 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>• Jessica Marie Garcia is an actress, writer and comedian best known for her role as Jasmine in Netflix series “On My Block” and Willow Cruz in Disney Channel show “Liv & Maddie”.<br>• She has a net worth estimated to be over $1 million.<br>• She moved to Los Angeles after high school and worked as a waitress while auditioning for roles.<br>• She starred in “Huge” and “Liv & Maddie” before gaining a recurring role in the sitcom “The Middle”.<br>• She is married to Adam Celorier and is active in raising awareness for plus-sized individuals in the entertainment industry.</p>﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h2><span id=Who_is_Jessica_Marie_Garcia>Who is Jessica Marie Garcia?</span></h2><p>Jessica Marie Garcia was born on 23 March 1987, in Orlando, Florida, USA. She is an actress, writer, and comedian, best known for being one of the cast members of the Netflix series “On My Block”, playing the character Jasmine. She also gained fame during her youth as Willow Cruz in the Disney Channel show “Liv & Maddie”.</p><h2><span id=The_Net_Worth_of_Jessica_Marie_Garcia>The Net Worth of Jessica Marie Garcia</span></h2><p>As of early-2020, Jessica Marie Garcia has a net worth estimated to be over $1 million, earned through what has eventually become a successful career as an actress. While she has been in the entertainment industry for many years, it was only recently that she started to gain a bit more attention, and the wealth that came along with it.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career_Beginnings>Early Life and Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Jessica grew up in Orlando – she is of Cuban descent from her mother while her father is Mexican. At a young age, she developed a strong interest in acting and loved performing – she often pretended to organize performances for her toys and stuffed animals at home. However, for most of her life, she suffered from obesity and this was one of the factors that derailed her momentum when she decided to pursue acting as a career.</p><p>After matriculating from high school, she opted not to enroll in college and instead moved to Los Angeles, California, where many aspiring actors try to look for their breakthrough. While going to auditions regularly, she began working as a waitress at a hamburger restaurant.</p><p>She started to gain minor or extra roles, which wasn’t enough to sustain her, so she continued her other jobs. To help her gain a bit of edge from her competition, she began extensively researching her scripts, and readjusting them to help fit her physical appearance, believing that there was still a lot of room for someone like her, as plus-sized women were scarce in the entertainment industry.</p><h2><span id=Rising_to_Fame>Rising to Fame</span></h2><p>One of Garcia’s first television projects was the series called “Huge”, which aired on ABC Family in 2010 for 10 episodes.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A palette-cleanser for your salty mouth 👅 <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/5TukObfFY7</a></p><p>— 𝕵𝖊𝖘𝖘𝖎𝖈𝖆 𝕸𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖊 𝕲𝖆𝖗𝖈𝖎𝖆 (@JessMarieGarcia) <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 27, 2020</a></p><p>The show is based on the Sasha Paley novel of the same name, following the story of eight teens who spent time in a weight loss camp named Camp Victory during the summer. She had a small role in the show, joining the likes of Nikki Blonsky and Hayley Hasselhoff. After its initial run, the show was&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>canceled</a>&nbsp;as no orders for any further episodes were given by ABC.</p><p>After working on the television movie “County”, Garcia experienced a bit of a breakthrough when she became a talent for Disney Channel, leading her to be cast as Willow Cruz in the original series “Liv & Maddie”, starring&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Dove Cameron</a>, Joey Bragg and Tenzing Norgay Taylor.</p><p>It follows the story of twins, one who returned home after being an actress for four years, and the other who was left behind while her sister became a star. It followed a documentary-style format, in which characters were given a chance to speak to viewers, or express their opinions through something similar to an interview, a popular format for reality shows.</p><h2><span id=After_Liv_Maddie>After Liv & Maddie</span></h2><p>“Liv & Maddie” lasted for four seasons and received positive reviews during its run, leading it to win a Mexico Kids Choice Award.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dcn_MjpU0AAvs0P-1-731x1024.jpg></p><p>Despite gaining a bit of attention from the show, Jessica Marie felt that she didn’t get what she deserved from the show, as executives referred to her as an&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>expensive extra</a>, not valuing her talents.</p><p>Nevertheless, she continued working, being cast in the comedy sketch show called “Betch” in which she joined the likes of Monica Sherer, Madeline Whitby and Audrey Whitby, and known for featuring other celebrities during its run. The show helped in developing her comedic skills further, and she was then cast in a recurring role in the sitcom “The Middle”, which tells the story of a family living in Indiana, and struggling with their day to day endeavors.</p><p>She stayed with the show for around four seasons, portraying a wrestler, while the show went on to run for nine seasons, and attracted mostly positive reviews.</p><h2><span id=On_My_Block>On My Block</span></h2><p>In 2017, Garcia was cast in the film “Avenge the Crows: The Legend of Loca”, about a former gang member in LA who goes on a journey of revenge alongside her younger cousin. The film didn’t get a lot of attention compared to her next project, as she was cast in the Netflix show “<a rel=nofollow href=#>On My Block</a>”, which tells the story of four teens living in the harsh inner city of Los Angeles. The four friends are just beginning high school, and they see many of their lives tested as they go on their day-to-day journey.</p><p>In the series, she portrays Jasmine Flores who is obsessed with group member Ruby played, by Jason Genao; Ruby is known to be the math whiz of the group, and the group’s conscience. She was initially a recurring character during its first season, but as the show progressed, she was&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>promoted</a>&nbsp;to a series regular. The show has been praised for its performances, diverse cast, and storytelling. Other stars of the show include Brett Gray, Sierra Capri and Diego Tinoco.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>It is known that Jessica became engaged to Adam Celorier in 2016; very little is known about him as the couple chooses to keep their relationship away from the spotlight – the two married two years later.</p><p>She often refers to her mother as her biggest source for inspiration, as she was the one who encouraged her to pursue acting as a career.</p><p>Aside from her work, Jessica is also active when it comes to awareness towards plus-sized individuals in the entertainment industry. She talks about how they are often stereotyped and criticized by the higher-ups, leaving them with very little in terms of opportunity. With drastic shift in ideals in numerous industries around the world, her voice along with many like her is becoming more pronounced.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDm6Con6KWvanFjaipoGeamsC0tcKaZKaZop6ybrPAq5qimV2WtKZ51p6goKCkYrmwv9JmnKefkZyypXnHrqqbmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-marie-garcia-age-weight-loss-engaged-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jonathan-majors-found-guilty-of-assaulting-his-then-girlfriend-grace-jabbari-inside-a-hired-car.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jonathan-majors-found-guilty-of-assaulting-his-then-girlfriend-grace-jabbari-inside-a-hired-car.html>Jonathan Majors found guilty of assaulting his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari inside a hired car</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./janae-collins-biography.html>Janae Collins Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./janae-collins-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
