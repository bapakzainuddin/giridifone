We are grateful for that.”</p><p>“We are disappointed, however, that despite not believing Ms. Jabbari, the jury nevertheless found that Mr. Majors was somehow reckless while she was attacking him.”</p><p>“Mr. Majors is grateful to God, his family, his friends, and his fans for their love and support during these harrowing eight months.”</p><p>“Mr. Majors still has faith in the process and looks forward to fully clearing his name.”</p><p>He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 6.</p><p>During Majors’ trial, Jabbari took the stand to testify that he would allegedly&nbsp;<a href=#>fly into a “violent” rage</a>&nbsp;during their relationship.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The actor was accompanied by his current girlfriend, actress Meagan Good. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>She told the jury that she and the actor, 34, began dating in August 2021 after meeting on the set of&nbsp;Marvel’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.”</p><p>Though Jabbari, 30, said their romance was great in the beginning, she claimed that things started to quickly change as time went on.</p><p>The British dancer alleged that she first became “scared” of Majors in December of that year when she brought up the fact that her ex-boyfriend had a dog.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">During the “Loki” actor’s trial, Jabbari took the stand to testify that he would allegedly&nbsp;fly into a “violent” rage&nbsp;during their relationship. <span class=credit>@gracejabbari/Instagram</span></figure><p>“It was the first time I felt scared of him,” Jabbari claimed to jurors. “I knew to never mention my ex again or anyone I had dated before.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jabbari claimed that after she and the “Lovecraft Country” alum would get into fights, he would refer to himself as a “monster” and would threaten to commit suicide.</p><p>“I pleaded with him [so that] he wouldn’t do that,” she alleged to the jury. “He would say, ‘It’s in place.

A great man. I am doing great things, not just for me, but for my, for my culture and the world. That is actually the position I’m in. That’s real. I’m not being a d–k about it. I didn’t ask for it.
