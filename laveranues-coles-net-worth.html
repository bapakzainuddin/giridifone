He was born in Jacksonville, Florida, on the 29th of December, 1977, when his mother was 16 years old.</p><p>How rich is Laveranues Coles? Sources estimate his net worth at $7.5 million as of early 2017, largely earned over his sporting career which spanned 2000 to 2010.</p><h3>Laveranues Coles Net Worth $7.5 million</h3><p>At Ribault High School, Coles played football, and was also on the basketball team, and ran track. He matriculated to Florida State University, where he graduated with a degree in Nutrition and Fitness. Coles was then selected in the third round of the NFL Draft in 2000 as a wide receiver by the New York Jets.</p><p>Coles stayed with the Jets until 2002, having experienced much success with the team. He then moved to the Washington Redskins, where he was offered more money, but returned to the Jets in 2005. In 2009, he signed a four-year deal for $28 million with the Cincinnati Bengals, greatly adding to his overall net worth. He was, however, released by the team after just a year.</p><p>Continuing his pattern of return, Coles signed a year-long contract again with the NY Jets in 2010, but was let go by the team after a month. No doubt shaken in confidence, Coles considered ending his career at that point, but went back to the Jets in December of that year to replace Jim Leonhard, who had been taken out due to injury.</p><p>Over his football career, Coles scored 49 touchdowns and ran 8609 yards receiving. He rushed for 231 yards and his longest carry was for 23 yards, in 2003 for the Washington Redskins. He went to the Pro Bowl in 2003, and won the Curtis Martin MVP Award in 2006.</p><p>In addition to his sporting career, Coles has one acting credit, as Sportscaster #1, in the 2010 Tyler Perry movie “Why Did I Get Married Too?”.</p><p>In his personal life, Coles spoke out in 2005 about how he was sexually abused by his mother’s husband as a child. The man in question, who has not been named, was imprisoned for his crime, though released early. He has since re-offended and remains imprisoned. Coles is a fairly private person, and rarely gives interviews. In his youth, Coles was nicknamed “Trouble”. He was engaged in 2008, after a five year relationship, to Kenda Fairchild, and was in the news in 2014 when their relationship turned sour, and he demanded a $240,000 engagement ring he had bought, back from her. He has one child, a son, named Trilion.</p><p>Coles has had a few incidents with the law. He was arrested in 1998 for simple battery. In 1999, he was removed from his college football team at Florida, after he and a teammate were arrested for committing grand theft. The incident, not as dramatic as it perhaps first sounds, happened because the two players happened to know the cashier working at the Dillard’s department store. He gave them a large discount, meaning that they paid only $21.40 for $412.38 worth of goods. Coles eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of petty theft.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.0235148514851><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Laveranues Coles</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 29, 1977</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Jacksonville, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>91 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Florida State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Trilion Coles</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Kenda Fairchild</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3070334/</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Why Did I Get Married Too?, Battle of the Gridiron Stars</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Battle of the Gridiron Stars</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Agreed to a four-year, $28 million deal with the Cincinnati Bengals days after being released by the New York Jets.
