<time>17 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A stand-up comedian, podcaster, actress and television, <a href=#>Nikki Glaser</a> is best known for hosting her eponymous show, <i>Not Safe with Nikki Glaser</i>. Since kicking off her stand-up career at the age of 18, Glaser has touched commendable heights in the industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on June 1, 1984, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Nikki got her breakthrough, performing stand-up on<i> The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Conan. </i>Glaser has since done a notable stint hosting various podcasts with notable names, including <strong>Anya Marina</strong>, and<strong> Andrew Collin</strong>, all while carving a career in television. &nbsp;</p><h2>Is Nikki Glaser Married? &nbsp;</h2><p>After decades of portraying her funny side to fans, Glaser adapted to a fresh change when she opened her personal life for fans in 2022. The 2022 reality show, <i>Welcome Home Nikki Glaser?</i> on E! showed Nikki being her real self with her family, and then-boyfriend, <strong>Chris Convoy</strong>, in her hometown of St. Louis. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/27/354790957_673605527925568_1784765104692866326_n%20(1)-1703701525020.jpg><p>The pandemic-filmed reality show ignited a slowly swirling marriage rumor since Glaser was spending more time with Chris, who she had dated on-and-off for eight years. Another reason further fueling the rumor was Nikki's comedy career that had took a blow during the lockdown period. &nbsp;</p><p>The reality show, which also included Glaser's parents, <strong>Julie </strong>and <strong>EJ, </strong>bestie <strong>Kerstin Robertson</strong>, and dog Walker, followed Glaser's conflicted love life with Convoy. The comedian-turned-host admitted her desire to settle down and also expressed her dismay over Convoy's unsure disposition. &nbsp;</p><p>"I want so badly to be able to say, 'Let's just f--king do it and get married," Glaser said on the reality show, adding, "We've been doing this off and on for eight years. Like, what are we doing?'" &nbsp;</p><p>Although the pair didn't get hitched or engaged on the show, the closest thing to it that Convoy could pull was getting down on one knee and asking Nikki to be his "emergency contact." "Hey, you got to start somewhere. It might not look like it, but this moment is huge for us,"<a href=#> said</a> the comedian. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Truth About Nikki Glaser and Chris Convoy's Relationship! &nbsp;</h2><p>Fans are certainly taking more interest in the Glaser's love life after seeing her loosen up more in her eponymous reality show. The podcast host hasn't revealed much about her dating experience but her 2022 E! show has divulged just enough about her relationship with Chris. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/27/396927557_18401099101009366_7060070161406089157_n%20(1)-1703701535117.jpg><p>Nikki met Convoy on the sets of MTV's late-night discussion show, <i>Nikki & Sara Live</i>. Although the show, hosted by Glaser and fellow comedian, <strong>Sara Schaefer</strong>, was cancelled after one season, it launched Nikki's romance with Convoy, who served as the producer on the show. &nbsp;</p><p>The couple reportedly started dating immediately but their romance only came to light when the two collaborated again on Glaser's <i>Not Safe with Nikki Glaser</i>, in 2016. Nikki admitted to dating the producer on and off for several years after the two were photographed together. &nbsp;</p><p>The comedian even dished on sharing workspace with her then-beau. "He is such a fantastic person to work with and he has made my show so great. I would never fire him," Nikki shared. Although Nikki is yet to confirm it, the pair are seemingly still working on their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Nikki Glaser's On-Off Boyfriend, Chris Convoy?&nbsp;</h3><p>The <i>FBoy Island</i> host has had only one man in her heart, Chris Convoy, in her life for almost a decade. As the comedian-turned-host continues to bring her romantic/sex life into her comedy delivery, while asserting that it doesn't necessarily points to her ongoing love life, Convoy is still choosing to keep mum. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/27/369311371_18383700190008341_53529547687157877_n%20(1)-1703701544783.jpg><p>Since coming into the spotlight as a cast member on <i>Welcome Home Nikki Glaser?</i> Convoy has pretty much kept it to himself, despite the inundating amount of attention from Nikki's fans. Aside from posting some cute posts on Instagram, that often reassures his slow, yet changing attitude toward Nikki, Chris is almost MIA when it comes to being a public figure. &nbsp;</p><p>Report shows that Convoy has been working in the industry for several years. Best known for collaborating with his on-off girlfriend, Convoy's profile also includes the tv series<i> Unplugged, Go Small Live Big, IHeartRadio Music Awards, </i>and <i>The Little Mermaid Live.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Nikki Glaser's Rumored Romances! &nbsp;</h3><p>Glaser has been grinding in the hustle bustle of the industry for over two decades, making it inevitable that she gets away with sparking a dating rumor or two. The comedian once revealed that she was 24 when she had her first boyfriend. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/27/317913728_5595346630549794_8300737451091302983_n%20(1)-1703701553645.jpg><p>Although she never dropped the name of her first love, some sources have revealed that the <i>Not Safe with Nikki</i> star had her first dating experience with <strong>Pete Lee</strong>, a comedian whom she met at the onset of her career.&nbsp;</p><p>Glaser was linked with comedian <strong>Mark Recine</strong> in the late 2000s. Although the reports at the time claimed that the pair were in a budding relationship, Glaser's indirect statement alluded to a casual fling. The comedian was briefly linked with <strong>Dan Soders</strong> and <strong>Bobby Bones </strong>when she and Convoy were on one of their breaks. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfqGWZqHqvtcqkoGafnJbApr6MnZitoZ6ceqbEz6Wmq6GenHqpsdFmo6iulWKwsLrNnpqtoZ%2Bj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-nikki-glaser-dating-exploring-her-love-connection.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./arnold-schwarzeneggers-son-christopher-shows-off-weight-loss.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./arnold-schwarzeneggers-son-christopher-shows-off-weight-loss.html>Arnold Schwarzenegger's son Christopher shows off weight loss</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./farm-aid-2023-where-to-buy-tickets-best-prices-lineup.html>Where to buy tickets, best prices, lineup</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./farm-aid-2023-where-to-buy-tickets-best-prices-lineup.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
